    "Let us understand the above piece of code step by step. There are two ways to create vectors, first one is dense and another is sparse. In a dense vector we specify all n elements and its values. The dense vector is simply created as ``Vectors.dense(4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 3.0)`` where as sparse is created as ``Vectors.sparse(4, Seq((0, 1.0), (3, -2.0)))`` wgere the first number if the number of elements/dimension in the vector, and the ``Seq`` given is a tuple of index, (value pair). Thus ``Vectors.sparse(4, Seq((0, 1.0), (3, -2.0)))`` is same as ``Vectors.dense(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, -2.0)`` as seen below"
